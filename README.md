## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

*   Node.js (v18 or later recommended)
*   npm, yarn, or pnpm
*   A MongoDB Atlas account and a connection string.

### Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    cd <repository-name>
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    # or
    pnpm install
    ```

3.  **Set up environment variables:**
    Create a `.env.local` file in the root of your project and add your MongoDB Atlas connection string:
    ```env
    MONGODB_URI="your_mongodb_atlas_connection_string_here"
    ```
    Ensure `.env.local` is added to your `.gitignore` file.

4.  **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    # or
    yarn dev
    # or
    pnpm dev
    ```
    The application will typically be available at `http://localhost:9002`.

5.  **Run the Genkit development server (optional, for AI feature development):**
    In a separate terminal, run:
    ```bash
    npm run genkit:dev
    ```

## üìÑ Project Structure (Key Directories)

*   `src/app/`: Next.js App Router pages (e.g., editor, login, register, settings).
*   `src/app/actions/`: Server Actions (e.g., authentication logic).
*   `src/components/`: Reusable React components (UI elements, layout, editor).
*   `src/ai/`: Genkit related files.
    *   `src/ai/flows/`: Genkit flow definitions (e.g., code explanation).
*   `src/lib/`: Utility functions (e.g., MongoDB connection).
*   `public/`: Static assets.

## üí° Future Enhancements (Ideas)

*   Real-time collaboration.
*   Saving and loading projects/files for users.
*   More advanced AI features (e.g., code generation, debugging assistance).
*   Integration with Git for version control.
